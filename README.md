# Base solution for using Unit Of Work

The base solution is divided into 4 layers:

Entity Layer: This layer is responsible for storing the entities (data models) that represent the database entities. It typically includes classes that map directly to the database tables or entities.

Application Layer: This layer contains the request and response models, as well as the interfaces for the Repository and Service layers. It acts as the intermediary between the API layer and the Infrastructure layer, handling the flow of data and business logic.

Infrastructure Layer: This layer is where the actual logic and data access operations are implemented. It includes the concrete implementations of the Repository and Service interfaces defined in the Application layer. This layer is responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

API Layer: This layer exposes the functionality of the application through a set of controllers. The controllers receive the incoming requests, pass them to the Application layer, and return the responses back to the client.

The key aspect of this solution is the use of the Unit of Work pattern, which helps to manage database transactions and ensure data consistency across multiple operations. The Unit of Work pattern provides a way to group multiple database operations into a single transaction, ensuring that either all operations succeed or all fail together.

In this base solution, the Unit of Work pattern is implemented in the Infrastructure layer, where the database interactions take place. By using the Unit of Work pattern, the application can ensure that related data changes are committed or rolled back as a single atomic unit, avoiding data inconsistencies that could arise from partial updates.

This layered architecture, combined with the Unit of Work pattern, provides a well-structured and maintainable solution for building applications that interact with a database. The separation of concerns between the layers allows for easier testing, scalability, and flexibility in the development process.
